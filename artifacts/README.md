# Neural Terra Hero Image Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the hero image that will be captured by the automated script.

The hero image will show:
- Neural Terra's cinematic 3D globe
- Weather layer active (temperature heatmap)
- Ports layer active (shipping routes)
- Suez Canal scenario running with ripple effects
- Professional dark theme with atmospheric lighting

To generate the actual hero image:
```bash
make capture-hero
```

This will create `artifacts/hero.png` with a high-quality screenshot of Neural Terra in action.
