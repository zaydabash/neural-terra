# Neural Terra Demo Script (30 seconds)

## Setup
1. Start the application: `make dev`
2. Wait for both services to be ready
3. Open http://localhost:3000

## Demo Flow

### 1. Initial Load (5 seconds)
- Show the cinematic globe with atmospheric effects
- Point out the dark theme and professional UI
- Highlight the "Neural Terra" branding

### 2. Layer Toggle Demo (5 seconds)
- Toggle Weather layer: "See real-time temperature data"
- Toggle Ports layer: "Major shipping ports worldwide"
- Toggle Grid layer: "Power grid stress indicators"
- Toggle Alerts layer: "System alerts and warnings"

### 3. Scenario Simulation (10 seconds)
- Click "Scenarios" button
