This directory contains older static demo HTML files and experimental artifacts that were used while prototyping Neural Terra.

- `index.html` and `neural-terra-demo.html` are standalone Tailwind demos that predate the current Next.js app.
- They are **not** wired into the production app or CI, and they may still contain emojis or marketing copy that does not reflect the current codebase.

These files are preserved only for historical reference. For the real application, see `apps/frontend` and `apps/backend`.
